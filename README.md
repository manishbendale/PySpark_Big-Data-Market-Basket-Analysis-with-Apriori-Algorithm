The probability of buying a particular product by customers may be based on several factors.
Factors such as the customer’s transaction history, demographic characteristics, and interests are examples of these.
So, what if we don’t have those factors. 
It means that the customer has not been to our store before and we don’t have his/her data (not even gender). 
In such cases, there are methods that we can find the products which customer might buy. 
Usually, the data used in these methods belong to the other customers who made purchases before in the store. 
These methods take all transactions, control each item (product) in the transactions, and 
find the patterns that show which products are mostly bought in the same basket by customers.
The methods that find these patterns are called Frequent Pattern Mining or Association Rule Mining
