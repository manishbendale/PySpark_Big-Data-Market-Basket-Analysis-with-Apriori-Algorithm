The likelihood of a customer buying a particular product may be based on several factors. For example, factors such as customer transaction history, demographic characteristics and interests. So, what if we do not have these factors. This means that the customer has never been to our store before, and we do not have his/her data (not even gender). In this case, there are some ways to find the products that the customer might buy. Usually, the data used in these methods belongs to other customers who have previously shopped in the store. These methods conduct all transactions, control each item (product) in the transaction, and find patterns that show which products are primarily purchased by customers in the same basket. The method of finding these patterns is called "frequent pattern mining" or "association rule mining"
